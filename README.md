The Eat-Da-Burger app featured on this page was built in two different ways: a version using sequelize and a version with a manual ORM system.  Both of these apps utilize a RESTful API and the handlebars template system.  Zachary Saltzman was responsible for all aspects of these apps.

Technologies Used: MySQL, Express, Node, and Handlebars as well as Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery

Description:

Users of the application can create custom named burgers and submit them through the form.  They are added to the MySQL database.  All database queries are run through a custom built ORM.
